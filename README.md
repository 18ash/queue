Queue-Enqueue-Dequeue-
Description
A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added. Here, we have performed two basic operations in queue, which are enqueue and dequeue. Enqueue is the process of inserting an element to queue. Dequeue is the process of removing an element from queue. Elements from queue are always removed from front of queue.

Example
Any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.
